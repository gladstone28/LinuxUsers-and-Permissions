Users, Groups, and Permissions in Linux

#### Introduction

Linux is a highly secure operating system. How? This lesson will dig into the way that Linux handles users, groups, and permissions to keep information secure.

Linux is designed from the ground up to prevent individual users from accessing areas of the file structure they shouldn’t access. Linux environment administrators have to define separate accounts and permissions to determine who can access specific files, directories, applications, and resources.

Throughout the lesson, we’ll go over:

- Classification of Linux users
- Users and groups
- File permissions
- Modifying users, groups, and permissions
- Admin-related commands
